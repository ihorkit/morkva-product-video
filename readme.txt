Add an MP4 video to WooCommerce product gallery, make your products stand out. Very simple to use.

== üëâÔ∏è Description ==

Morkva Product Video lets you attach an MP4 video to any WooCommerce product - simple, fast, and theme-friendly integration:

‚úÖ MP4 video field per product (supports relative or absolute URLs to files hosted on your site).

‚úÖ Thumbnail is always placed second in the gallery (position control is read-only in free).

‚úÖ Basic playback preferences (Autoplay / Loop / Mute at start).

‚úÖ Works with popular themes (incl. Flatsome, Storefront, Block themes).

‚úÖ Lightweight and Performance-friendly: the gallery still loads its images as usual; the video uses preload="none".

Need catalog autoplay previews and advanced behaviors (e.g., single page autoplay that replaces the main image, or choosing last position in gallery)? Check out the Pro version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which video formats are supported? =
MP4/H.264 is recommended and used by default. Other containers/codecs aren‚Äôt guaranteed across all browsers. Keep bitrates modest for fast playback (e.g., 720p‚Äì1080p, 3‚Äì8 Mbps).

= Can I use an external image URL as the thumbnail? =
No. The thumbnail must be selected from the Media Library so that WooCommerce can inject it into the product gallery.

= Where does the thumbnail appear? =
In the free version it‚Äôs always the second gallery item.

= Does this affect Core Web Vitals? =
The plugin sets the video to preload="none". The gallery images load as usual; video bytes are not fetched until needed. For best results, keep your thumbnail optimized and sized similarly to product images.

= Will it work with my theme? =
It works with most themes that use the standard WooCommerce gallery hooks. We‚Äôve tested with Flatsome, Storefront, and block-based themes. If your theme replaces the gallery entirely, results may vary.

= Does it support variable products? =
Yes‚Äîthe video is attached to the product (not to variations). If you need per-variation videos, that‚Äôs custom work.

= Can I autoplay in catalog or swap the main image automatically on the product page? =
Those enhanced behaviors are Pro features.
